# Introduction to scalability
The capability of a **system** to maintain **performance** under increased **load** by adding more **resources**.

## Common Terminology
- System
- Performance
  - Not crashing under load
  - Available to serve new requests
  - Responding in a reasonable number of time (latency)
  ***important***: the performance of any individual request does not need to improve as we scale out, just needs to remain within bouads, under high loads
- Load
- Resources
  - Computing powers
  - Memory
  - Number of Physical Machines
  - Number of Secondary Storages (Disks)
  - Network Bandwidth

  // Bandwidth describes the maximum data transfer rate of a network or Internet connection. It measures how much data can be sent over a specific connection in a given amount of time. For example, a gigabit Ethernet connection has a bandwidth of 1,000 Mbps, (125 megabytes per second).
